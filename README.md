# AI-Project
Project Name: Applied AI Image Reconstruction Using a Genetic Algorithm
Description: Our project aims to create an artificial intelligence that will train to take and recreate an image, starting with simple two-colored images and possibly into grayscale images. We will do this with a genetic algorithm based on Charles Darwin’s theory of natural evolution, where the AI will learn from mistakes and become stronger by creating the image faster and faster as it learns.
